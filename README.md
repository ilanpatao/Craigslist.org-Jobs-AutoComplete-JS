# Craigslist.org-Jobs-AutoComplete-JS
Description: Poll Craigslist.org most recently posted jobs data into an AutoComplete styled div containing job titles, descriptions and links. Includes a live example of AutoComplete input and Json output.

Technical: JS/Jquery based XHR request to Craigslist.org using Google CSE requesting real-time search results returned by the same index Google uses to display Craigslist results. Simply add and reference the JS file to pull results on your application.

Usage ideas: Web apps and/or sites that wish to display jobs (local or national) on their platform. Automatically obtain the latest postings for further automation. Widgetize and include location-based autocomplete search for any job posting containing certain keywords or based in hyperlocal areas on your platforms. Build the first step of automation by referencing real-time data for hyper-localized job postings in your developments. Automate/Data capture, or scrape; directly from a real-time json feed to populate your data sets.
